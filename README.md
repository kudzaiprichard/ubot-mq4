<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

### Project Scope

An automated trading system (ATS), a subset of algorithmic trading, uses a computer program to create buy and sell orders 
and automatically submits the orders to a market center or exchange.The computer program will automatically generate orders 
based on predefined set of rules using a trading strategy which is based on technical analysis, advanced statistical 
and mathematical computations or input from other electronic sources.


* Should allow users to input parameter properties like stop loss and take profit etc.
* Expert system should be able to automatically open trades, manage, scale trades and manage trades. 
* Trading bot must also be able to manage trades in terms of trailing profit, scaling position, maintaining long and short trading

## Project Design

### Architecture

<div align="center"> 
 <img src="images/Automated-trading-system-protocols.jpg" alt="architecture Diagram" >
</div>

Taking all above into consideration, the traditional architecture of the entire 
automated trading system can now be broken down into:

`The exchange(s)` â€“ the external world

`The server`
* Receives market data
* Stores the market data
* Store orders generated by the user

`Application`
* Takes inputs from the user initially for the decisions such as stop loss, limits, the preferred financial instrument for trading etc.
* Acts as an interface for viewing the information including the data and orders
* Acts as an order manager sending orders to the exchange

<div align="center"> 
 <img src="images/Algo-trading-system.jpeg" alt="architecture Diagram" >
</div>

The `market data`, that is received, typically `informs` the automated trading system of the latest order book.
It may also contain some additional information like the `volume traded` so far, the last traded price, 
and the quantity of the `trading order`. However, to make a `decision based on the data`, the automated system looks at
the old values or `derives certain patterns` from the history. Based on this historical analysis of data and patterns, 
the system goes forward to create a `trading strategy` and execute the same.

Last but not least, a GUI interface is needed for the trader to view all this information on a screen.

### Built With
System was written in `Meta Quotes 4`, language that is supported by `Meta trader 4`:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have the below software installed in your pc :
* Meta Trader 3
* Meta Quotes 3
* and your preferred IDE or text editor

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kudzaiprichard/ubot-mt4
   ```
3. Inside meta editor click on `file`, and choose `open data folder`

4. `Open mql4 folder`, and copy `Experts/ ubot` mql4 source file to `Experts folder`

5. Copy `Include/Ubot` folder to include folder

6. Copy `indicators/Ubot` folder to indicators folder

7. Close and `open meta editor` then open `ubot mql4 source file` and `run it`

   > NB: An `ubot complied ex4` file program will be created

8. The same complied `ubot ex4 file` will appear in `meta trader 4`

   > NB: Use that complied `ubot file` to run your bot on the market or test it in `mt4 strategy tester`


### Usage
1. Open meta trader 4
2. Drag and drop the bot in desired chart to run the bot
3. The following bot `interface` will show 

    <div align="center">
        <br/>
        <img src="images/botinterface2.png" alt="report">
    </div>
   
4. Double tap on the `Inputs` tab

    <div align="center">
        <br/>
        <img src="images/botinterface1.png" alt="report">
    </div>

5. Enter desired `inputs settings` for your bot or import settings and press `ok` button
6. The bot will then run and will display the interface screen when running successfully
    
   <div align="center">
        <br/>

    </div>
   
> NOTE: Bot should display that dashboard at the far right bottom corner

### Results
Below is the UML design of the system including relationships between the difference objects that make up the system
